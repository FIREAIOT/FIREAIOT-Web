## Abstract

In this proposed project, the proposed idea is build autonomous IoT based firefighting station that is responsible for extinguishing fire all around the world from one centralized server unit. The server will be responsible of handling the incoming fire alarms from custom user-friendly mobile applications distributed that are accessible online. The app logic server also is responsible of communicating with registered UAVs in the system and perform cloud based vision prediction on the fly to reduce power consumption and increase flight time.

## Problem Statement

Extinguishing fire is a critical and challenging problem in our daily life which requires tons of different tools and equipment in addition to well-trained firefighters, despite the technological development of the used tools, it still a quite challenging problem to solve.

For the mentioned reasons, the intention of the proposed idea in this project is to improve the ordinary way of extinguishing fires. In that, unmanned aerial vehicles are extremely useful for this mission due to their abilities to access places that are hard for a human to reach. Moreover, it is not required to have a human being on board in order to control them.
